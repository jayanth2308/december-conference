        <h1> About The workshop</h1>

        <h2>The objective of the workshop is to provide participants with a
            comprehensive understanding of the fundamental
            concepts, advanced technologies, and practical applications of
            wireless and molecular communications. By
            exploring these topics, the workshop aims to achieve the
            following objectives<h2>

                        "It is envisioned that the next decade would see a much
                        higher penetration of academic activities by the
                        industries and absorbing their requirements. Through
                        this conference, IIIT Sri City aims to create a
                        benchmark for industry-based research and technology
                        conferences in India. The participants would not
                        only involve traditional researchers and academic
                        faculties, but also industry-based developers,
                        technical architects, analysts and techno-managers so
                        that they have the opportunity to interact,
                        participate and set the tone for conference
                        presentations and interactions."
